In discussions about World War Two, many people often cite the high kill numbers of German and Japanese pilots. The problem is to usually try to use these numbers to make various points and how effective the Axis forces were. 

 Well there are many problems with this luckily the third most successful German ace in World War actually spoke out on this in a polite and indirect manner he answered the question, "why did German aces have so many kills compared to Allied Pilots" 

 I will use this answer and expand on it a bit. Gunter Val outlined several conditions: first off he notes that in order to shoot down an enemy plane you need a sufficient number of them in your mission area. Many allied pilots in the later stages of the war never saw a German plane any miffed it did they often heavily outnumbered the foes in contrast this situation was very uncommon for the German side after late  after all the phase the Soviet Union British Empire and the United States each of them usually matched all numbered the Germans in total planes alone together their considerable numerical advantage let's just look at the initial numbers for Operation Barbarossa at the time of the German attack the Soviet Air Force consists of about to , aircraft of which  were deployed in the Soviets Western theater where's the chair many of us had around aircraft deployed for Operation Barbarossa even early in the war during the Battle of Britain in summer the Germans had about the same number of fighter planes as the British during the height of the battle in August fighter commanded around , fighters which was about the same number as the Luftwaffe this strategic disparity in planes didn't necessarily transfer down to the tactical situation because the Germans to a certain degree could decide when and where to engage the Allied aircraft particularly when they were attacking Germany and the occupied territories thus technical victories were still common and those improved to kill accounts of German pilots the next point mentioned Berger in Tehran is that Western Allied Pilots usually had a limited number of missions to fly and then they were rotated out or could return home to the lack of German pilots this wasn't the possibility hence German pilots do revolt until they were killed captured or incapable of continuing the fight in one way or another there were other factors as well like the initial superiority of German training in combat pilots to do the pre bubble up and experiences from the Spanish Civil War furthermore nearly every major country used a different system for accounting of kills and losses involved or to additionally especially in air combat the kill claims for oversights could be up to twice as high as the losses of the enemies in short there are many problems of deriving valid and comparable kill to death ratio from these values across different countries let's take a look at the bigger picture one way to properly determine the effectiveness of combat pilot is by taking a look at the average file because in a total war the achievements of exceptional individuals rarely have an effect above the tactical level but the combined force of a large number of soldiers pilots or sailors usually is the determining factor that has a strategic effect this is the reason why proper training programs are so important something both the Germans and the Japanese didn't put enough emphasis on during the war thus armed forces should not be charged solely based on the current or initial quantity in quality but also in the ability to maintain this quantity and quality throughout a war to conclude comparing the individual achievements of a caesura doesn't provide meaningful information about major aspects of the air war it usually only serves as an excuse for nationalistic tendencies and/or content which in a way is probably the same thing most people know that national pride is important and I agree with that but I think real pride has no need for a comparison it comes from within and not from an outside measuring stick after all it is important that we respect the achievements and service of all men and women that serve no matter if the flu missions with no kills over aces with more than kills quite many pilots that once fought each other became friends after a war I think this will of has great examples that mutual respect is a true virtue of a hero and that despite various differences and honest agreement on core values like respect is more important than the color of our flags thank you for watching please like comment share and subscribe and see you next time you
