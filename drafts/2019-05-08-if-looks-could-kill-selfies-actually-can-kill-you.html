<p>A 2018 paper in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care looked into the rates of selfie-related deaths around the world and found some surprising results. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131996/">Selfies: A boon or bane?</a> was authored by Agam Bansal, Chandan Garg, Abhijith Pakhare, and Samiksha Gupta from Community and Family Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India and the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie">Selfie</a>’s are “<em>photograph[s] that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.</em>” Selfies became popular with the widespread adoption of smartphones, and almost overnight social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were flooded images of people’s faces.</p>
<p>But these aren’t head shots or Glamour Shots (yes, those are <a href="https://www.glamourshots.com/galleries/">still a thing</a>). Selfies have a distinct look and feel because of the almost obsessive levels of detail placed on getting just the right angle, framing and side of the face (yes, there is a right side, and it’s <a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2017/release/selfies-did-you-get-your-best-side">NOT the right side</a>).</p>
<p>Many people have criticized them, too. They’ve been called the <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a23557/selfies-arent-art/">“<em>the masturbation of self-image</em>”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ux0d1oQdCQ">“<em>virtual "mini-me," what in ancient biology might have been called a "homunculus" – a tiny pre-formed person that would grow into the big self.</em>”</a> Whatever your opinion is on selfies, the authors make a pretty strong case for paying attention to how dangerous they can be.</p>
