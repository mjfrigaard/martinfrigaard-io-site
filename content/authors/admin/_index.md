Hi! I am Martin Frigaard -- I'm a data scientist with 15+ years of experience with data analysis, visualization, statistics, and research. When I am not actively programming for my day job, I like to design and create training materials and workshops on data management, visualizations, reproducible research, and application development. I'm also the Co-founder of Paradigm Datagroup ([PDG](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/paradigmdata/)) and [a fully certified Posit `tidyverse` trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).
