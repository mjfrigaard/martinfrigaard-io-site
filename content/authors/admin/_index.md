Hi! I am Martin Frigaard -- R programmer and Co-founder of Paradigm Datagroup (PDG). I create training materials and workshops on data management, visualizations, and reproducible research. I also build shiny applications (and occasionally write R packages). I have 15 years of experience with data analysis, statistics, and research. [I'm also a fully certified RStudio `tidyverse` trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).
