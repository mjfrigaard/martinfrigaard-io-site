I have eight years of experience working in research, data management, and clinical statistics. I’ve been using R & RStudio for the past five years (but can also use Stata, Microsoft SQL server, and MySQL).

# Data Analytics Training:

I’m happy to provide your team or organization with any of the following courses:

- Data Programming Toolbox: An intro to Git, Unix, Shell scripting, Git/Github, project organization, Docker, R, and RStudio (a one-day workshop)

- Storytelling for Data Impact: Data collection, wrangling, visualization, and communication with tidyverse tools (a two-day workshop)

- Shiny fundamentals: creating applications and dashboards with R and RStudio (course length depends on customer needs)

I’m willing to travel to your office for on-site instruction. I can adapt all of my courses to your needs.

# Education:

I have a MAS in Clinical Research from the University of California, San Francisco. The focus of my research was on the validation of electronic health record data in clinical decision making. I’ve taught university courses in epidemiology and statistics. I enjoy helping people learn how to use data to gain insight and make evidence-based decisions.
