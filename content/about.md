Hi, I'm Martin. I've been working with data management, analysis, and statistics for the past eight years. Below is a *Reader's Digest* version of my experience:

## 2011 - 2015

I started at the Center for Nutrition and Activity Promotion (now the [Center for Healthy Communities](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/)) in 2011. During which time I worked as a Research Scientist on the following projects:

- A Longitudinal Study of Overweight, Elevated Blood Pressure, and Acanthosis Nigricans Among Low-Income Middle School Students. **Authors:** Dana Kopping, Holly Nevarez, Keiko Goto, Irene Morgan, Martin Frigaard, & Cindy Wolff. This was my first statistical analysis and peer-reviewed manuscript. [article here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147837)

- Identifying Red Flags: Using Anthropometry Measures to Screen for Elevated Blood Pressure Risk in Children. **Authors:** Martin Frigaard, Keiko Goto, Cindy Wolff, Stephanie Bianco-Simeral, & Thomas Fahey. I re-wrote my masters thesis after graduating because I read this [great article on science writing](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing). I recommended it to everyone who does any kind of technical writing. Check out the [article here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1941406412470719).

- In 2014 I wrote an [opinion piece](https://www.newsreview.com/chico/clarity-on-childhood-obesity-rates/content?oid=13239774) in response to some shoddy statistical reporting by the New York Times. It was my first time writing to a larger audience, and I discovered how challenging and difficult it was to explain statistical concepts. Writing this small article was very pivotal in motivating me to pursue additional training in statistics/research design. 

## 2015 - 2018

In 2015 I went back to school for clinical research at University of California, San Francisco. During this time I worked as a Research Associate for the veterans hospital in the [Kidney Health Research Collaborative](https://khrc.ucsf.edu/) with Dr. Carmen Peralta. Dr. Peralta was investigating how to use electronic health record data to screen/identify patients with chronic kidney disease. The two papers I was involved with are listed below. 

- Implementation of a pragmatic randomized trial of screening for chronic kidney disease to improve care among non-diabetic hypertensive veterans. **Authors:** Carmen A. Peralta, Martin Frigaard, Anna D. Rubinsky, Leticia Rolon, Lowell Lo, Santhi Voora, Karen Seal, Delphine Tuot, Shirley Chao, Kimberly Lui, Phillip Chiao, Neil Powe and Michael Shlipak. [article here](doi: 10.1186/s12882-017-0541-6).

- Validating laboratory defined chronic kidney disease in the electronic health record for patients in primary care. **Authors:** Martin Frigaard, Anna Rubinsky, Lo Lowell, Anna Malkina, Leah Karliner, Michael Kohn and Carmen A Peralta. [article here](doi.org/10.1186/s12882-018-1156-2).

I started contributing to Northeastern's Journalism Blog, [Storybench](http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/). I love writing R tutorials and articles because I've always loved the R community and open source software.

In 2017, I created my first Shiny application for the Diabetes Technology Society's [Blood Glucose Monitor System (BGMS) Surveillance Program](https://www.diabetestechnology.org/surveillance.shtml). The application takes the output from a blood glucose monitor and determines the surveillance error grid and accompanying statistics. The process was eye-opening and made me think of research products outside a traditional report or paper (i.e. turning research into useful tools). 

## Current

- In 2019, a colleague and I started Paradigm DataGroup, a company that provides data fluency workshops and statistical consulting. We have a unique collection of skills and tools that we've found to be very helpful in solving data problems. We also love teaching these skills to wider audiences, so if you have a question or would like to discuss a project, please email me at `mfrigaard@paradigmdata.io`.

# My toolset

I use R and Rstudio, but can also use Python, SQL, Stata, SPSS, and all things Microsoft.

## Data fluency workshops & training:

I’m happy to provide your team or organization with any of the following courses:

- Data Programming Toolbox: An intro to Git, Unix, Shell scripting, Git/Github, project organization, Docker, R, and RStudio (a one-day workshop)

- Storytelling for Data Impact: Data collection, wrangling, visualization, and communication with tidyverse tools (a two-day workshop)

- Shiny fundamentals: creating applications and dashboards with R and RStudio (course length depends on customer needs)

I’m willing to travel to your office for on-site instruction. I can adapt all of my courses to your needs.

## Other services:

- On the job R/RStudio tidyverse Training  
- Data wrangling, organization, and management in the tidyverse  
- Shiny Web Application/Dashboard Development  
- Data Visualization (`ggplot2`)  
- Reproducible Reporting (`rmarkdown`)  
- Thesis/dissertation statistics consulting 

## Availability:

Please contact me two-weeks in advance to allow for scheduling/travel

# Education:

I have a Master's in Clinical Research from the University of California, San Francisco. The focus of my research was on the validation of electronic health record data in clinical decision making. I also have a Master's in Kinesiology and Bachelor's in Exercise Physiology from California State University, Chico. 

# Teaching Experience 

At CSU Chico, I taught two undergraduate [courses](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/13/KINE/EXERNONEBS.html) Sports Epidemiology (KINE 386) and Principles of Strength and Conditioning (KINE 390), and Statistical Methods in Kinesiology Research (KINE 601). 

While at UCSF I was a TA for the [Big Data course](http://ticr.ucsf.edu/courses/schedule/data_science.html) in the biostatistics department.

I've always enjoyed helping people learn how to use data to gain insight and make evidence-based decisions.
