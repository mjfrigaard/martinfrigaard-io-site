Hi! I'm Martin Frigaard, Data Scientist and Co-Founder of Paradigm Datagroup. I provide workshops, write tutorials, and build applications for anyone who works with data. I grew up in Sandy, Oregon, but I currently live in Oakland, California.

## How I got started 

I started working with statistics at the Center for Nutrition and Activity Promotion (now the [Center for Healthy Communities](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/)) in 2010. During my time at CHC, I worked with the research and evaluation team on projects that investigated associations between [blood pressure, obesity](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1941406412470719), and various [medical conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147837). I also helped [design studies](https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.28.1_supplement.1019.19) using behavioral economics and social marketing to influence elementary school kids to eat more fruits and vegetables. In 2014 I wrote an [opinion piece](http://bit.ly/cnr-obesity-rates) in response to some shoddy statistical reporting by the New York Times. It was my first time writing to a broader audience, and I discovered how challenging and rewarding it could be to communicate statistical concepts. 

## Statistical & scientific training

In 2015 I moved to Oakland, California, and went back to school for [clinical research](http://ticr.ucsf.edu/courses/masters.html) at the University of California, San Francisco. During this time, I worked as a Research Associate for the veterans hospital in the [Kidney Health Research Collaborative](https://khrc.ucsf.edu/) with Dr. Carmen Peralta. Dr. Peralta was investigating how to use electronic health record data to [screen/identify patients with chronic kidney disease](http://bit.ly/ckd-screen-trial). My research looked at the [validity of the data](doi.org/10.1186/s12882-018-1156-2) being used to guide clinical decisions about the care of patients with chronic kidney diseases. 

## Data science communication 

In 2016, started contributing to Northeastern's Journalism Blog, [Storybench](http://www.storybench.org/). The posts have since evolved into [Data Journalism in R](http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/) (a collection of 30+ tutorials). I enjoy writing these tutorials and articles because of the broad range of problems R can solve. All of the peripheral tools in the R ecosystem ( [`shiny`](https://www.shinyapps.io/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ) make it possible to think of research results outside a traditional report or paper.

I've also always been impressed with how welcoming and supportive the R community and open source software can be. 

## Teaching

At CSU Chico, I taught two [undergraduate courses](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/13/KINE/EXERNONEBS.html) Sports Epidemiology (KINE 386) and Principles of Strength and Conditioning (KINE 390), and a section of the graduate course Statistical Methods in Kinesiology Research (KINE 601). 

While at UCSF, I was a TA for the [Big Data course](http://ticr.ucsf.edu/courses/schedule/data_science.html) in the biostatistics department.

I've always enjoyed demystifying statistics, computer science, and technology.

## Apps

I built created a Shiny app for the Diabetes Technology Society's [Blood Glucose Monitor System (BGMS) Surveillance Program](https://www.diabetestechnology.org/surveillance.shtml). This application takes the output from a blood glucose monitor and determines the surveillance error grid and accompanying statistics. Building the results of a [peer-reviewed paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1932296814539590) into an app was eye-opening and changed the way I approach research questions and solutions. 

I've found thinking about how the answer to a particular question can be used to solve future problems or give continuous insights. Framing research questions like this forces me to put the results into a much broader context. 

## Our company

In 2019, a colleague and I started Paradigm DataGroup, a company that provides data fluency workshops and statistical consulting. We have a unique collection of skills and tools that we've found to be very helpful in solving data problems. We also love teaching these skills to wider audiences, so if you have a question or would like to discuss a project, please email me at `mfrigaard@paradigmdata.io`.
