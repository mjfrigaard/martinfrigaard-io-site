title: Blood Glucose Monitoring System Surveillance Program

The [BGM/SEG Shiny App](https://www.diabetestechnology.org/seg.shtml) was initially part of the Diabetes Technology Society's Blood Glucose Monitor Surveillance Program (see original research [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1932296814539589) and [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1932296814539590)). I helped the authors of that study convert the findings in their paper to a shiny app.
