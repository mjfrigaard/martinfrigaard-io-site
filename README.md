===========

This is Github repo for my personal website. I built this website with [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

## Using the academic theme

I created this website following the excellent [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1139846569623281664) by Dan Quintana. I've included information anywhere the directions from the Twitter thread were incomplete, incorrect, or outdated. 

### Install `blogdown` and `hugo` 

Run the following code to install `blogdown` (also make sure you have Hugo installed). 

```r
install.packages("blogdown”)
library(blogdown) 
blogdown::install_hugo(force = TRUE)
```
