      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Martin Frigaard, Data Scientist and Co-Founder of Paradigm Datagroup. I provide workshops, write tutorials, and build applications for anyone who works with data. I grew up in Sandy, OR but I currently live in Oakland, CA.
How I got started I started working with statistics at the Center for Nutrition and Activity Promotion (now the Center for Healthy Communities) in 2010. During my time at CHC, I worked with the research and evaluation team to design projects that investigated associations between blood pressure, obesity, and various medical conditions.</description>

      <description>The WW2 fighter pilot data These data come from the Wikipedia page here, and I went over downloading these data in my previous post.
In this post, Iâ€™ll be covering some data wrangling and manipulation with the tidyverse. I will also be using the janitor, inspectdf, and ggplot2 packages.
Load the packages library(tidyverse) library(inspectdf) library(janitor)   Download data The data from the previous post have been stored in a Github repo here.</description>

      <description>This post covers how to scrape a Wikipedia table of World War II (WWII) flying aces, store it in an R data frame, and export these data into a comma-separated values (.csv) file.
The data I want to download a table of World War II flying aces from Wikipedia. To do this I will need functions from xml2, rvest, dplyr, stringr, lubridate, and readr.
library(xml2) library(rvest) library(tidyverse) Download html page into object in R First I want to store the web url into a string vector in R.</description>
