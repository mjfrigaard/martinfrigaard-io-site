<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Martin Frigaard, Data Scientist and Co-Founder of Paradigm Datagroup. I provide workshops, write tutorials, and build applications for anyone who works with data. I grew up in Sandy, Oregon, but I currently live in Oakland, California.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-got-started">How I got started</h2>

<p>I started working with statistics at the Center for Nutrition and Activity Promotion (now the <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/">Center for Healthy Communities</a>) in 2010. During my time at CHC, I worked with the research and evaluation team on projects that investigated associations between <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1941406412470719">blood pressure, obesity</a>, and various <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147837">medical conditions</a>. I also helped <a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.28.1_supplement.1019.19">design studies</a> using behavioral economics and social marketing to influence elementary school kids to eat more fruits and vegetables. In 2014 I wrote an <a href="http://bit.ly/cnr-obesity-rates">opinion piece</a> in response to some shoddy statistical reporting by the New York Times. It was my first time writing to a broader audience, and I discovered how challenging and rewarding it could be to communicate statistical concepts.</p>

<h2 id="statistical-scientific-training">Statistical &amp; scientific training</h2>

<p>In 2015 I moved to Oakland, California, and went back to school for <a href="http://ticr.ucsf.edu/courses/masters.html">clinical research</a> at the University of California, San Francisco. During this time, I worked as a Research Associate for the veterans hospital in the <a href="https://khrc.ucsf.edu/">Kidney Health Research Collaborative</a> with Dr. Carmen Peralta. Dr. Peralta was investigating how to use electronic health record data to <a href="http://bit.ly/ckd-screen-trial">screen/identify patients with chronic kidney disease</a>. My research looked at the <a href="doi.org/10.1186/s12882-018-1156-2">validity of the data</a> being used to guide clinical decisions about the care of patients with chronic kidney diseases.</p>

<h2 id="data-science-communication">Data science communication</h2>

<p>In 2016, started contributing to Northeastern&rsquo;s Journalism Blog, <a href="http://www.storybench.org/">Storybench</a>. The posts have since evolved into <a href="http://www.storybench.org/category/data-journalism-in-r/">Data Journalism in R</a> (a collection of 30+ tutorials). I enjoy writing these tutorials and articles because of the broad range of problems R can solve. All of the peripheral tools in the R ecosystem ( <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/"><code>shiny</code></a>, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, and the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/"><code>tidyverse</code></a> ) make it possible to think of research results outside a traditional report or paper.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also always been impressed with how welcoming and supportive the R community and open source software can be.</p>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>At CSU Chico, I taught two <a href="https://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/13/KINE/EXERNONEBS.html">undergraduate courses</a> Sports Epidemiology (KINE 386) and Principles of Strength and Conditioning (KINE 390), and a section of the graduate course Statistical Methods in Kinesiology Research (KINE 601).</p>

<p>While at UCSF, I was a TA for the <a href="http://ticr.ucsf.edu/courses/schedule/data_science.html">Big Data course</a> in the biostatistics department.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed demystifying statistics, computer science, and technology.</p>

<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>

<p>I built a Shiny app for the Diabetes Technology Society&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.diabetestechnology.org/surveillance.shtml">Blood Glucose Monitor System (BGMS) Surveillance Program</a>. This application takes an output from a blood glucose monitor (BGM) and determines the surveillance error grid and accompanying statistics. Building the results of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1932296814539590">peer-reviewed paper</a> into an app was eye-opening and changed the way I approach research questions and solutions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found thinking about how the answer to a particular question can be used to solve future problems, or put into a tool to provide continuous insights. Framing research questions as &ldquo;what kinds of future problems could an answer to this question solve?&rdquo; forces the results into a much broader context.</p>

<h2 id="our-company">Our company</h2>

<p>In 2019, a colleague and I started Paradigm DataGroup, a company that provides data fluency workshops and statistical consulting. We have a unique collection of skills and tools that we&rsquo;ve found to be very helpful in solving data problems. We also love teaching these skills to wider audiences, so if you have a question or would like to discuss a project, please email me at <code>mfrigaard@paradigmdata.io</code>.</p>
