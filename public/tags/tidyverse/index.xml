 This is part 3 of 5 in a series looking at World War II flying aces. In part 1, I showed how to download data from a Wikipedia (html) table. Then in part 2, I showed some wrangling techniques with dplyr and janitor, and some exploratory data analysis with inspectdf. We discovered that Germany had the highest average number of aerial victories. In this post we will look at the casualties and survivability of flying aces in WW2.</description>

      <description>These data come from the Wikipedia page here, and I went over downloading these data in my previous post.
 The WW2 flying aces data In this post, I’ll be covering some data wrangling and manipulation with the tidyverse packages. I’ll also be using the janitor, and inspectdf packages.
Load the packages library(tidyverse) library(inspectdf) library(janitor)   Download data The data from the previous post have been stored in a Github repo here.</description>
